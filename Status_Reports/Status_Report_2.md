						  Semester Group Final Project
								Status Report 2
								  11/22/2015
===============================================================================

	What was accomplished during the week:
	- Made a clear plan for what would get accomplished over Thanksgiving break
	- Decided to pause work on the facebook notification button and focus on
	  quiz creation, after reading Ming's comments from last status report
	- Continued work on database (which should now be shared with Ming)
	- Continued to work on layout and charts
	- Got random question generation and quiz scoring to work with hard-coded
	  song data (This is what most of our time was spent on)

	Challenges and issues our team faced during the week:
	- We had a bit of a busy week, and since Assignment 3 was due Friday, we
	  did end up submitting this status report a couple of days late due to
	  the chaos of working on Assignment 3 Friday night.

	Our goals for next week:
	- Unite the random question generation ability with the songs that we have
	  gotten from the spotify API so that our song data will not have to be
	  hard-coded
	- Figure out how specifically we will use local storage to keep a record of
	  how the user is doing on the quizzes, and implement this.
	- Unite the quiz generation and scoring ability with the charts to display
	  actual quiz score data
	- Continue to develop the look and feel of our pages
	
	#Comments by Ming
	* Are you comfortable with using the Spotify API?  
		If so, can you give a 5 minute demo on how to use it?  
		There are lots of teams that would love to know what you did.
