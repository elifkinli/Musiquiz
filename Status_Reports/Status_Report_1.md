===============================================================================

	What was accomplished during the week:
	- Database setup (server-side data persistence)
	- Used google charts API to generate charts to display quiz results 
		(graphs only display static data, and therefore is not pushed onto git)
	- Figured out how to get songs/song information from Spotify API
	- “Login through Facebook” button finished, working
	- “Share with a Friend” button finished, working
	- Developed page layouts more clearly

	Challenges and issues our team faced during the week:
	- We had a bit of trouble working with the Spotify API. However, we were
	  able to figure this out by the end of the week.
	  (This code is also not on git, as it is on the heroku repository.)
	- We also found getting Facebook notifications to work to be a bit
	  challenging. This has not yet been resolved, so it is a goal for next
	  week.

	Our goals for next week:
	- Get sending of Facebook notifications to work
	- Begin working on use of local storage to keep a record of how the user
	  is doing on the quizzes and other info between pages (client-side data
	  persistence)
	- Begin trying to connect the charts to actual stored data
	- Begin using song information to create quizzes
	- Continue to develop the look and feel of our pages

		* " Get sending of Facebook notifications to work" 
						--how important is this?
		* "Begin working on use of local storage to keep a record of how the user
	  	is doing on the quizzes and other info between pages (client-side data
	  	persistence)" and "Begin using song information to create quizzes" 
	  					--now these are important.

	* "(This code is also not on git, as it is on the heroku repository.)" 
						--sounds good.  Share with me the Heroku repo.
