							Comp 20 Web Programming 
						  Semester Group Final Project
								Status Report 3
								  12/04/2015
===============================================================================

	What was accomplished during the week:
	- Edited README to reflect slight changes in our webapp implementation
	- Integrated quiz page design with code to generate the quiz
	- Got songs to play on the page from Spotify, figured out where and
	  when we will make these requests and how we will use the information
	  that is returned to us. This will allow us to eliminate the hard-coded
	  song data.
	- Used local storage to keep track of the users' scores, as well as the
	  genre of the quiz.

	Challenges and issues our team faced during the week:
	- Getting our songs to play on the page took us a long time, but we were
	  able to figure it out.
	- Getting our server to work with our frontend code was also a challenge,
	  but we have worked this out as well for the most part.

	Our goals for next week:
	- Keep track of usernames and user high scores on our server
	- Improve the responsiveness of our pages and other small style details
	- Continue working on the displaying of user scores and high scores
	  using google charts
